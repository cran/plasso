   abstract = {We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multi- nomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

    abstract = "{This paper reviews, applies, and extends recently proposed methods based on double machine learning (DML) with a focus on programme evaluation under unconfoundedness. DML-based methods leverage flexible prediction models to adjust for confounding variables in the estimation of (a) standard average effects, (b) different forms of heterogeneous effects, and (c) optimal treatment assignment rules. An evaluation of multiple programmes of the Swiss Active Labour Market Policy illustrates how DML-based methods enable a comprehensive programme evaluation. Motivated by extreme individualised treatment effect estimates of the DR-learner, we propose the normalised DR-learner (NDR-learner) to address this issue. The NDR-learner acknowledges that individualised effect estimates can be stabilised by an individualised normalisation of inverse probability weights.}",
